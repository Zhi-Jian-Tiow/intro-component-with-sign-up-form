## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla Javascript for form validation

### What I learned

- Strengthened my CSS skill
- Using Javascript to query and add HTML elements


### Continued development

I want to continue working on several projects using vanilla Javascript before moving into React framework. This would allow me to have stronger foundation and understand better how React would ease up the development process.
